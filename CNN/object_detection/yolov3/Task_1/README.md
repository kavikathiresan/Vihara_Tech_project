## yolo_v3
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. The YOLO machine learning algorithm uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object.Darknet-53 is a convolutional neural network that acts as a backbone for the YOLOv3 object detection approach.
